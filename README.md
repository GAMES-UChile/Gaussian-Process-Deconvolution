# Gaussian-Process-Deconvolution

This repository contains the code used in

- Felipe Tobar, Arnaud Robert, Jorge Silva. Gaussian Process Deconvolution. *Proceedings of the Royal Society A*, in press, 2023. 

This repository replicates the illustrative examples and the experiments in the paper:
- Folder `f1` contains the examples and the first experiment (deconvolution of an audio signal)
- Folder `f2` contains the second experiment (non-blind/blind deconvolution of images)

In addition to replicating the simulations in the paper, the code here is currently under development and thus might inclde additional experiments.

All data used in the article (and this repo) is either synthetic or public. Experiment 1 uses audio data from [here](http://www.mcsquared.com/reverb.htm), while Experiment 2 uses [CIFAR-10](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html).
