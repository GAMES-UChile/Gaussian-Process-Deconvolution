# Gaussian Process Deconvolution

This repository contains the code used in

- Felipe Tobar, Arnaud Robert, Jorge F. Silva. Gaussian process deconvolution. *Proceedings of the Royal Society A*, in press, 2023. 

The code replicates the illustrative examples and the experiments in the paper:
- Folder `f1` contains examples and the first experiment (deconvolution of an audio signal)
- Folder `f2` contains more examples and the second experiment (non-blind/blind deconvolution of images)

All data used in the article (and this repo) is either synthetic or public. Experiment 1 uses audio data from [here](http://www.mcsquared.com/reverb.htm), while Experiment 2 uses [CIFAR-10](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html).
 
For an up to date version of this code, which might include additional experiments, please visit the Github repository [https://github.com/GAMES-UChile/Gaussian-Process-Deconvolution](https://github.com/GAMES-UChile/Gaussian-Process-Deconvolution)
